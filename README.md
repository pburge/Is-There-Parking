# Is There Parking?
=================

Home for the "Is There Parking?" mobile app. Mainly built with Angular, this app, when completed, would give a user a very basic ability to pinpoint their location and see where parking is located. The way they could see would be where other registered users would pinpoint a spot that they have seen, and using the user's geoposition, would set a Google marker right on top of where they are.
