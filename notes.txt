---mobile app
next 2 weeeks final project bootcamp
day 9 is alpha, day 10 is final
must be in angular. data must come in from api or db. or both
must use a mobile-first front end framework, testing will be done on a mobile device. 
site must be mobile first.
think about how to market the app to users (be it word of mouth or fliers);

--topic or idea and ways of distribution
one question: how are people going to know about the product?
-there was an app name roomies where one could sign up with roomates to track bills. 
-a budget mngmt system that emails people depending on the due date.

g4tv: dice - design outside the box:



--target audience is toward fullsail students.
something that addresses an issue. 
for example: "should i ride my bike today" -- checks weather and says yes or no.

--notes:
COMMENT EVERYTHING (specifically, logics);




---idea:
"is there parking?"
-this app is used to sort of check if there's parking. 

-the only drawback is that this requires all students who drive to use the app.

-before they leave the house, they would check if there are any spots open. 

-they would then get some kind of notification saying how many approximate spots are left and where they're located.

-once they park, they take a moment to enter what lot they're in and use geo-location to say what spot they've taken.

-users can gain "parking points" by pointing out open spots (probably using geo-location or by entering the spot number);

-	after pointing out the spot, the app would cross reference with a db that says whether the spot is open or not and award
	the user accordingly.

-	after a certain amount of earned points, the user can turn those in for free starbucks coffees or...a small lunch at
	crispers or firehouse.

-	to prevent abuse, users can only point out 2 or 3 spots per day so they won't go on a saturday or sunday and just point
	out spots all day.

----------------------------

maybe have a referal
have a system limit as to how long they wil be open
an approzimate spot.
